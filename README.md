## Description

Spotimy is a back-end built for the Spotify music community. It allows users to friend other music fans, create thoughts about favorite artists and react to other users' thoughts. Users can also delete their own thoughts, reactions and friends when in heated arguments about favorite music.

## Installation

Once the repository is downloaded, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the server. The server will run on `localhost:3001` by default or on a port specified by the user.

## Usage and Testing

Once installed, the user can test the API routes using Insomnia Core. The user can create, read, update, and delete users and thoughts. The user can also add and remove reactions and friends from their friends list.
